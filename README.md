# zoom_open
Opens a zoom link and inserts a password. Useful for reoccurring meetings

2DO:

In the shell script change:
* virtual environment settings to fit your system
* python path (to be callable from any location or I wrote an applescript to open it)
* zoom link and password

In the python file:
* play around with the timings
* make sure the mouse position to click on the zoom password window is correct
